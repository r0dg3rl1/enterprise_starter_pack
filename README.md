# enterprise_starter_pack
Inspired from the "starter pack" meme, e.g.

- "The Karen Starter Pack" with images of a short asymmetrical bob cut, shouting at retail store staff.
- "The Mid-life Crisis Starter Pack" with images of a Harley Davidson and flashy cars.
- "The Finance Bro Starter Pack" with images of The Wolf of Wallstreet, boat shoes and linen shorts.

The Enterprise Starter Pack is all the I.T. infrastructure an enterprise or enterprise wanna-be would deploy, automated through infrastructure as code.
